Steps to write join query: 
    service id
    description
    service charge
    status => services table

    Provider Id
    Provider name => service provider table
        1. Find the tables need to join
        2. Write the join query with table name only
        Ex: "SELECT FROM mainTable aliyas JOIN subTable sub_table_aliyas"
        3. Write needed output next to SELECT
        Ex: "SELECT aliyas.output1, aliyas.output2, sub_table_aliyas.output1 FROM JOIN subTable sub_table_aliyas";
        4. Need to find JOIN CONDITION. To find that, need get common columns in both tables. 
        After that, need to write that condition finally.
        EX: "SELECT aliyas.output1, aliyas.output2, sub_table_aliyas.output1 FROM mainTable aliyas JOIN sub_table subTable_aliyas ON aliyas.commonColumnName = sub_table_aliyas.commonColumnName"

Human  Readable date code: 
// if (isset($_POST['req']) && $_POST['req'] == 'dateReq') {

//     $dataOf = $payment->getPaymentInfoById(1);

//     echo $dataOf["date_time"];
//     // echo var_dump($dataOf);


//     // Create a DateTime object with the current date and time
//     // $now = new DateTime();

//     // // Set the timezone (optional, you can skip this if you want to use the default timezone)
//     // $now->setTimezone(new DateTimeZone('Asia/Colombo'));

//     // // Format the date and time in a human-readable format
//     // $humanReadableDateTime = $now->format('l, F j, Y \a\t g:i A');

//     // // Output the human-readable date and time
//     // echo "Current date and time: $humanReadableDateTime";
// }
