Steps to write join query: 
    service id
    description
    service charge
    status => services table

    Provider Id
    Provider name => service provider table
        1. Find the tables need to join
        2. Write the join query with table name only
        Ex: "SELECT FROM mainTable aliyas JOIN subTable sub_table_aliyas"
        3. Write needed output next to SELECT
        Ex: "SELECT aliyas.output1, aliyas.output2, sub_table_aliyas.output1 FROM JOIN subTable sub_table_aliyas";
        4. Need to find JOIN CONDITION. To find that, need get common columns in both tables. 
        After that, need to write that condition finally.
        EX: "SELECT aliyas.output1, aliyas.output2, sub_table_aliyas.output1 FROM mainTable aliyas JOIN sub_table subTable_aliyas ON aliyas.commonColumnName = sub_table_aliyas.commonColumnName"
