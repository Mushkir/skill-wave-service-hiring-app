# Skill-Wave Service Hiring Web Application

The Skill-Wave Service Hiring Application is a web app designed to assist individuals in finding and hiring various service providers when they are in unfamiliar locations. This application offers a wide range of services, including doctors, mechanics, plumbers, and many more. It leverages real-time location data to provide users with suggestions for service providers based on their current location, making it easy for users to find the help they need quickly and efficiently. The frontend of the application was developed using HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive interface. The backend is powered by PHP (PDO) and MySQL, which manage the server-side operations and data storage. This project was undertaken as part of a final year project for a Software Engineering degree, showcasing practical implementation of location-based services to enhance user experience.
